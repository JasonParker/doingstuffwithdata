# ML for WeRateDogs
**Idea**: Create a deep learning algorithm that can generate a WeRateDogs-style comment + rating when given an image of a good dog (they're all good dogs, Brent).

**Why**:
 - It would be cool.
 - It would be a great way to walk through a lot of different ideas, concepts, and technologies while building an end-to-end example of something.
 - Maybe [Matt](https://twitter.com/dogfather) becomes my friend.

**What would it take**: 
 - Training data: Images from
   [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates)
-  Use the Twitter API to pull down data
	- Python `requests` library
	- Insomnia
- Discussion of deep learning + neural nets
- Transfer learning
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)
- Lots and lots of Python
- Deployment on OpenShift or something similar

Could potentially even create a website --> Generate your own dog rating with NLP, partner up?
