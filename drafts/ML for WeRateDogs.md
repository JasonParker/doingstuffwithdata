# ML for WeRateDogs
**Idea**: Create a deep learning algorithm that can generate a WeRateDogs-style comment + rating when given an image of a good dog (they're all good dogs, Brent).

**Why**:
 - It would be cool.
 - It would be a great way to walk through a lot of different ideas, concepts, and technologies while building an end-to-end example of something.
 - Maybe [Matt](https://twitter.com/dogfather) becomes my friend.

**What would it take**: 

 - Training data: Images from
   [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates)
   5. Use the Twitter API to pull down data
   6. Discussion of deep learning + neural nets
   7. Transfer learning
   8. [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)
   9. Lots and lots of Python
   10. Deployment on OpenShift or something similar

Could potentially even create a website --> Generate your own dog rating with NLP, partner up?
