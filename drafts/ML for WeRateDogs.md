# ML for WeRateDogs
**Idea**: Create a deep learning algorithm that can generate a WeRateDogs-style comment + rating when given an image of a good dog (they're all good dogs, Brent).

**Why**:
1. It would be cool.
2. It would be a great way to walk through a lot of different ideas, concepts, and technologies while building an end-to-end example of something.
3. Maybe []()
