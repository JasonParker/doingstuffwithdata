# ML for WeRateDogs
**Idea**: Create a deep learning algorithm that can generate a WeRateDogs-style comment + rating when given an image of a good dog (they're all good dogs, Brent).

**Why**:
1. It would be cool.
2. It would be a great way to walk through a lot of different ideas, concepts, and technologies while building an end-to-end example of something.
3. Maybe [Matt]([https://twitter.com/dogfather](https://twitter.com/dogfather)) becomes my friend.

**What would it take**: 
4. Training data: Images from [WeRateDogs]([https://twitter.com/dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates))
5. Discussion of deep learning + neural nets
6. Lots and lots of Python
7. Deployment on OpenShift or something similar
